        What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?

        <p>
        Refresh token:
          <br />
          A refresh token just helps you re-validate a user without them having to re-enter their login credentials multiple times. <br />
          Access token: <br />
          The access token is re-issued, provided the refresh token is a valid one requesting permission to access confidential resources.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1 className='text-xl font-medium'> They work and where should we store them on the client-side :</h1>
        <p>1. The client application sends the user's credentials (e.g., username and password) to the authentication server.</p>
        <p>2. The authentication server verifies the credentials and, if valid, generates an access token and a refresh token.</p>
        <p>3. The authentication server verifies the credentials and, if valid, generates an access token and a refresh token.</p>
        <p>4. The client application includes the access token in subsequent requests to access protected resources on the server. </p>
       <p>5. When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token from the authentication server, without requiring the user's credentials.</p>
      <p>6. If the refresh token is valid, the authentication server issues a new access token to the client.</p>
     
      <p>7. The client continues to include the new access token in future requests, repeating the process when necessary.</p>

        Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?
        </h1>
        <hr className="my-1 border-2 md:mr-24 border-stone-500" />
        <p>
        SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

        What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?
        </h1>
        <hr className="my-1 border-2 md:mr-24 border-stone-500" />
        <p>
        Aggregation is a way of processing a large number of documents in a collection by means of passing them through different stages. The stages make up what is known as a pipeline. The stages in a pipeline can filter, sort, group, reshape and modify documents that pass through the pipeline.
        </p>
        <h1 className='text-xl font-medium'>work :</h1>
        <p>$match stage – filters those documents we need to work with, those that fit our needs <br />
        $group stage – does the aggregation job <br />
         $sort  stage – sorts the resulting documents the way we require (ascending or descending)</p>
